# sustaincylce

SustainCycle Project
This project represents a multi-page website for "SustainCycle," an initiative focused on promoting recycling and sustainable practices. It features a clean, modern, and responsive design across all its pages, aiming to provide a visually appealing and user-friendly experience.

Project Pages
The SustainCycle project is structured with the following key pages:

Home (index.html): Likely the landing page, introducing the SustainCycle initiative and its core mission.

Login (login.html): Provides a secure entry point for users to access their accounts.

Rewards (rewards.html): Showcases incentives or points users can earn through their participation in recycling programs.

Pickup (pickup.html): A form-based page allowing users to schedule pickups for their recyclable waste.

Learn (learn.html): Offers educational content, tips, or resources related to recycling and sustainability.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For structuring the content and defining the layout of each web page.

CSS3: Extensively used for styling, responsive design, animations, and visual effects (like gradients, shadows, and backdrop-filter).

Google Fonts (Poppins): Integrated for a modern and highly legible typographic style across the entire website.

JavaScript (Optional/Basic): The js/main.js file is included, suggesting potential for client-side interactivity, form validation, or dynamic content loading (though specific functionality is not detailed in the provided CSS).
